# MAQBot (Most Asked Question)

WIP

  Target users: Broadcasters on Twitch.tv
  
  Given a channel name the program will begin logging chat data and creating a record of the most asked
  questions and most common messages while scrubbing emotes from the message. This is currently being 
  developed as a two part program, one for logging and another for analyzing post-broadcast.
  
  Logger Features:
    general chat Logging
    log multiple chats at once
    log multiple chats' questions to seperate files
    persistent records for channels
    
  Analyzer Features:
    MAQ displayed for specified channel
    partial search to find questions manually.
